# PathFinding-Visualizer
It is pathFinding visualizer that were developed using SDL Graphics Library in C++. Graph data structure is used as backend and visualized graph algorithm on grid like terrain.

# Features
* Interactive Grid : Create and modify the grid to set start and end points, and place obstacles.
* Connection Type : Path Exploration in grid like terrain can be done either in 4 connections or in 8 connections format.
* Color Animation : Provides an elegant display of color over each grid block like gradient.
* Algorithm : Currently algorithms supported are DFS, BFS and Dijsktra.


# Improvements and Bugs
* New algorithms like Bi-directional search, A* algorithm, Swarm-intelligence algorithm and greedy best-first algorithm can be implemented.
* Block collision detection 
* Path reconstruction ( Bug )
* Graphic user interface to enhance user experience

Note : This project is underdevelopment.

# KeyBindings
* Left Mouse Click : Place blocks

* b : Run BFS Algorithm
* c : To clear grid
* s : To select source
* t : To select target
* q : To display static color over gridblocks 
* a : To display dynamic color over gridblocks
* 4 : To enable 4 connections
